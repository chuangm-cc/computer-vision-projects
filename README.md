# Computer Vision Project

This repository is my **classical and modern computer
vision projects**, implemented from scratch in Python, with a focus on
geometric vision, visual recognition, and learning-based methods.

The projects contain **3D reconstruction, augmented reality, motion tracking,
image classification, and neural networks**, and are organized to reflect
real-world computer vision pipelines commonly used in research and industry.
